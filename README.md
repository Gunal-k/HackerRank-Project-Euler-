# Project Euler+ Solutions | HackerRank

This repository contains my Python solutions to the **Project Euler+** problems on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/projecteuler). These problems combine mathematical concepts with programming to develop efficient, optimized solutions.

## 🚀 About Project Euler+
Project Euler+ challenges focus on:
- Number theory
- Combinatorics
- Prime numbers
- Modular arithmetic
- Efficient algorithms

All problems are designed to be solved under time and memory constraints, making performance-critical code a key factor.

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- Algorithmic thinking  
- Mathematical problem-solving  
- Python programming  
- Optimization techniques

## 📁 Structure
Each solution file is named based on the problem number and contains:
- A brief description (as per HackerRank)
- Python implementation
- Comments explaining the logic

## 📌 Note
These problems are different from the original [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems and are hosted exclusively on HackerRank.
